// Add all IPs you want to ban from using the website to this file! 
// IP-ban is only "useful" for Hamachi-based servers as users IP don't change so often.
//
// Add 1 IP per line! Since 0.0.3 this file allows ranges/wildcards.
//
// Some examples: 
//
// 192.168.*.*
// 192.168.2.[1-100]
// 123.[1-100].[200-250].24		would ban IPs like 123.1.220.24 but NOT 123.1.220.23 ;-)
